### Explore bikeshare data in three major cities of the US

### Description
The project asks the user to type a city name (Chicago, New York City or Washington), a month name, and a weekday name.
Then the bikeshare data in the specific city, month and weekday will be loaded and analyzed.
Statistics of the data, such as the most frequent times of travel, most popular stations, trip duration and user counts,
will then be provided. Lastly, users will have the option to see the raw data which will be presented per 5 lines.
Users will also be prompted to restart the program to explore more data if interested.
